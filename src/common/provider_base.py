"""
Abstract base classes for data and trade providers.

This module defines the interface contracts that all market data providers
and trade execution providers must implement to ensure consistent behavior
across different broker APIs.

The async iterator pattern (iter_ticks, iter_metrics) abstracts both WebSocket
and REST connection patterns:
- WebSocket providers yield data as it arrives from real-time streams
- REST providers implement internal polling and yield data at intervals
- Consumer code remains agnostic to the underlying transport mechanism
